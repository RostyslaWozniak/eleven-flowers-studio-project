          "question": "How to take care of a bouquet at home?",
          "answer": "To ensure your bouquet stays fresh for a long time, follow these simple rules:\n\n1. **Trim the stems.**\n Cut them 1-2 cm at an angle, preferably with a sharp knife, so the flowers absorb water better.\n\n2. **Use a clean vase.**\n   Fill it with fresh, cool water.\n\n3. **Add flower food.**\n   If you received a sachet of flower food, add it to the water.\n\n4. **Change the water.**\n   Replace it every 1-2 days, rinsing the vase each time.\n\n5. **Avoid drafts and sunlight.**\n  Place the bouquet in a cool spot, away from direct sunlight, heaters, and fruit, which can speed up the wilting of the flowers.\n\n6. **Remove wilted flowers.**\n  Regularly remove any dried parts to prevent them from contaminating the water."
